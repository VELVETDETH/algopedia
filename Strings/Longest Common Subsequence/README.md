Longest Common Subsequence
==========================

**Problem statement:** Given two string of characters, a and b, compute the
*longest common subsequence*, that is, the largest subset of characters appearing in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

**Time complexity:** `O(n^2)`

**Examples:**

Input:

> AGCAT GAC
> 
> ABCD EFGH
> 
> XMJYAUZ MZJAWXU

Output:

> GA
> 
> 
> 
> MJAU
