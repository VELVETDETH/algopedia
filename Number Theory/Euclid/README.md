Euclid's Algorithm
==================

This is one of the first known algorithms.

**Problem statement:** Given two integers, x and y, compute the
*greatest common divisor*, that is, the largest positive number that
evenly divides x and y.

**Time complexity:** `O(log y)` in the worst case (when x and y are
consecutive Fibonacci numbers).

**Examples:**

x = 3
y = 4

Result: 1

x = 10
y = 5

Result: 2

x = 234
y = 69

Result: 3
